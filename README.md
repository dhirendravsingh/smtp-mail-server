**Simple SMTP Server**

A basic SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server implementation in Node.js using the `smtp-server` library. This project demonstrates:

- **Email Reception**: Capable of receiving emails from different domains.
- **Logging**: Logs connection details, sender, recipient, and email content for debugging purposes.
- **Basic Configuration**: Set up to allow insecure authentication and optional authentication for educational purposes.

**Key Features:**
- Logs SMTP session events like connection, sender, and recipient.
- Prints email content to console (in a real-world scenario, this would be stored or processed further).

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Understanding of SMTP protocol basics.
- Insight into email routing, headers, and content structure.
- Familiarization with DNS records relevant to email (MX, SPF, DKIM concepts).

**Usage:**
- Clone this repository
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Run the server with `node server.js` (assumes you've named your script file `server.js`)

**Note:** This server is for educational use only. It lacks security measures like TLS encryption, proper authentication, and does not handle emails beyond logging them. For production use, significant enhancements in security, error handling, and email processing are necessary.

**Future Improvements:**
- Implement proper authentication mechanisms.
- Add TLS support for secure connections.
- Enhance error handling and logging.
- Database integration for storing emails.

This description provides context for your project, explains what it does, highlights what one might learn from it, and gives warnings about its limitations. It also invites contributions which could be beneficial for collaborative learning or project enhancement. Remember to update the script name if it's different from server.js in your setup.
